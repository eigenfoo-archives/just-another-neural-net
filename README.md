# Just Another Neural Network

Description of Data Set:

The dataset is the famous MNIST dataset of handwritten digits (a link to the
dataset can be found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)).

There are 1797 32x32 bitmaps, each featuring a single numerical digit. The 32x32
bitmaps were divided into nonoverlapping blocks of 4x4, and the number of
filled-in pixels were counted for each block. This gives an 8x8 input matrix,
where each entry is an integer between 0 and 16, inclusive.
